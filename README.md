# Description

Puts your talents, and your spec swap buttons, in the character panel.

Also moves the equipment sets menu out of its tab so that it's always available.

Adds a tome button that automatically uses a tome out of your inventory.
	Displays useful information such as when a talent is on cd, when you are in a rest area, and for how long your current tome buff will remain active.

# Additional Notes
Don't open the actual talents window or it will mess up the talents in the character panel. Just unbind that window - you won't need it unless you are a hunter changing your pet's talents.

This addon makes your character panel look pretty ugly.

# Addon interactions
## ElvUI
You must unskin the talents pane in order to see what talents you have selected.
## Deja character stats
Deja stats panel does not show up in combat, and you get a lua error, if you open the character panel in combat.
