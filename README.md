# Description

Puts your talents, and your spec swap buttons, in the character panel.

Also moves the equipment sets menu out of its tab so that it's always available.

When out of combat, adds a tome button that automatically uses a tome out of your inventory.
	Displays useful information such as when a talent is on cd, when you are in a rest area, and for how long your current tome buff will remain active.

# Additional Notes
Don't open the actual talents window or it will mess up the talents in the character panel. You may as well just unbind that window.

This addon makes your character panel look pretty ugly.

# Addon interactions
## ElvUI
You must unskin the talents pane in order to see what talents you have selected.
